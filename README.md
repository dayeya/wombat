# Wombat Programming Language
> [!CAUTION]
> HUGE DISCLAIMER - THE LANGUAGE IS STILL IN DEVELOPMENT STAGE. 
> USE IT WITH YOUR OWN RISKS.

# Why?
Why not?, It is a fun project to work with a complex learning curve making the time I've invested in it worth it. <br>
For a long time I wanted something new to work with, something *FUN*, so why not create my own?

# Development Goals
- [X] Compiled
- [X] Statically typed
- [ ] Rich and easy-to-understand syntax 
- [ ] Fast to ship, fun to develop.
- [ ] Cross-platform. DISCLAIMER - ATM THE COMPILER SUPPORTS ONLY UNIX-OS. 
- [ ] **Readable** and professional, by encforcing developers who are usually dismissive of clean code to start sticking to it.
- [ ] Turing-complete

# Language vision
Here, you can find wombats visions.

Hello, World! - using wombat
```
import std.fmt;

fn free main()
    print "Hello, World!";
end
```

Please check ```/lang``` for more examples of wombats easy-to-understand syntax.
